I'm a self-driven mechatronics engineer. I work on a variety of projects to keep myself diverse. With skills spread over a variety of technologies, I've gotten hands-on experience with systems and tools at various levels. From working on front-end interfaces with React down to engineering custom game controllers and robots, I offer a diverse, full-stack experience. I'm always open to learning more and I am happy to talk if you want to know more. Thank you for stopping by!
